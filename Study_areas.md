## Appendix: Study areas

This appendix provides brief descriptions of the geographic areas used as case
studies in this paper:

Empowering ecological remote sensing learning: the `imageRy` R package to help students and instructors

### 1. Tofane and Passo Falzarego (Italy) – used for Figures 1, 2, 5, 8. 9 

The Tofane massif and the Passo Falzarego area are located in the Dolomites,
Northern Italy. This mountainous region is characterized by steep elevation
gradients, complex terrain morphology, and heterogeneous land cover, including
alpine grasslands, coniferous forests, bare rock, and seasonal snow cover. The
area represents a challenging and illustrative test case for ecological remote
sensing analyses due to strong topographic effects and high spatial variability
in spectral responses.

### 2. Mato Grosso (Brazil) - used for Figure 4

The Mato Grosso study area is located in central-western Brazil and encompasses
a mosaic of land-cover types associated with tropical forests, savannas
(Cerrado), and agricultural landscapes. The region is widely used in remote
sensing studies because of its rapid land-use dynamics and strong contrasts
between natural and managed ecosystems. This area provides an effective example
for demonstrating large-scale image analysis and classification workflows in
tropical environments.
